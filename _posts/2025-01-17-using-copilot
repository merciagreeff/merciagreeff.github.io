Yesterday I did something cool.

In order to make use of GitHub's recent free Copilot access, I created a Jupyter Notebook for the first time in Visual Studio Code.

I then formatted stress transformation formulas in LaTeX and Python.

Then I asked Copilot to create code from the formulas.  It worked very well!
