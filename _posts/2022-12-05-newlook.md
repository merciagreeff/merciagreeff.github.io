I watched some videos on YouTube about static site generators, and stumbled on [How to make a personal website with github pages by Kathryn Schuler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZsgPgGdOzQ).

I then chose the [Hitchens](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/hitchens) theme on [https://jekyllthemes.io](https://jekyllthemes.io) to create a new look.

I'm hoping the modular nature of the posts makes it easy enough to switch in future.
