I started this blog last night and tried to follow the steps at [https://github.com/skills/github-pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages).

There were errors I didn't understand spamming my email inbox, and so today I recreated most of the files in a new repository.

I also played around trying to get comments on this post, using [https://aristath.github.io/blog/static-site-comments-using-github-issues-api](https://aristath.github.io/blog/static-site-comments-using-github-issues-api). It worked mostly, but not fully, due to my very basic understanding of putting together a website.

Any comments are welcome at [https://github.com/merciagreeff/merciagreeff.github.io/issues/1](https://github.com/merciagreeff/merciagreeff.github.io/issues/1) :)
