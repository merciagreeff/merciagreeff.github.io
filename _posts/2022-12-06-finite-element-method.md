For a while now, I have thought of trying to implement a finite element analysis program.  Or find an appropriate implementation to look at.

I have a copy of the [Concepts and Applications of Finite Element Analysis, 4th Edition by Robert D. Cook, David S. Malkus, Michael E. Plesha, Robert J. Witt](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Concepts+and+Applications+of+Finite+Element+Analysis%2C+4th+Edition-p-9780471356059), and have been looking at that off and on. 

I recently started looking at [Object-Oriented Finite Element Framework by Albertus Hendrik Olivier](https://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/52971).  Unfortunately the supporting documentation and files are not available for download on the website.  I have sent an email request to SUNScholar to see if they can make it available, and am still awaiting a response.

Any comments are welcome at [https://github.com/merciagreeff/merciagreeff.github.io/issues/3](https://github.com/merciagreeff/merciagreeff.github.io/issues/3) :)
