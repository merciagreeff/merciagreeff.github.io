I was looking for a Jekyll theme that was more in line with what I wanted, in terms of look and feel, and some more features, and settled on the [So Simple](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/so-simple-theme) theme.

Every time I change something, I realise how much more I have to learn (about everything).
