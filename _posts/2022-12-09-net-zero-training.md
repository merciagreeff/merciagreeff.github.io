I am currently busy with the [Green Building Council South Africa (GBCSA)](https://gbcsa.org.za/) Net Zero Accredited Professional training.

I have previously successfully completed the Green Star New Buildings and Major Refurbishments, as well as Green Star Existing Building Performance Accredited Professional training.

Some interesting things to note from the South African Net Zero tool are as follows.

* The current rating tool does not yet take embodied carbon into consideration - something to look forward to in future.
* The rating tool considers not only Net Zero Carbon, but Net Zero Water, Net Zero Waste and Net Zero Ecology as well.

I have completed both the online training and one day workshop portions of the training.  Next is the final assessment - developing a strategic plan for a given case study, including a 2-minute audio or video-recording to pitch your strategy to the client.
